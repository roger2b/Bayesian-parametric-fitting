# Bayesian-parametric-fitting
Fast and accurate component seperation of primary CMB and Galactic polarised foregrounds

## codes
foreground_cleaning_pixel.py - main code to read in uncleaned CMB data and noise covariance matrices and perform a Bayesian parametric fitting. 
plot_cleaned_map.py          - code to read outpouts from foreground_cleaning_pixel.py to plot results and output maps (all as .txt files) 

## next steps
This repository performs the computations pixel-by-pixel.
